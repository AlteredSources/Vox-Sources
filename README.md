You should 100% use Dark's script, its auto updated as well as being toggleable, these sources are only provided so that you can build on the existing scripts if you feel like you are able to add anything to them or if you feel these are valuable for learning how js source editing works.

File beginning with "0" = Xray Dungeon update for July 22nd patch

File beginning with 7 = ESP/xray/Recoil

Ore Xray is self explanatory, when used alongside Dark's script it will reveal Ores when in xray mode.

Will keep edited if I figure other shit out
